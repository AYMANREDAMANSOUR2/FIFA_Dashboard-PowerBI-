# ⚽ FIFA Dashboard - Power BI Project

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing FIFA player data across FIFA 21, FIFA 22, and FIFA 23.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

This project began with **raw, unprocessed FIFA player data**.

I cleaned and prepared the data from scratch using:
- **Python** (Pandas) for merging, filtering, and initial transformation
- **Power Query** inside Power BI and Excel for final data shaping and normalization

Key steps included:
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant fields
- Unifying column structures across versions
- Extracting and combining the **top 6,000 players** from each FIFA version based on their Overall rating
- Normalizing tables (up to 2NF) to improve performance and clarity in analysis
